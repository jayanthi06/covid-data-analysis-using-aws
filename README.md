# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project performs data transformation, exploration, visualization, and trend analysis using the **COVID-19 Lake Dataset**.  
It aims to uncover insights about infection trends, vaccination progress, and regional comparisons to support better understanding of the pandemic.

## 📦 Dataset Source

- **Dataset URL:** [COVID-19 Lake Data Browser](https://covid19-lake.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/databrowser.html)
- **Data Includes:**  
  - Case counts
  - Death rates
  - Testing rates
  - Vaccination numbers
  - Hospitalizations across countries and regions

---

## 📚 Project Overview

- Explored global COVID-19 spread patterns over time.
- Analyzed vaccination distribution and its impact on infection rates.
- Compared top countries based on cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Highlighted key timelines like second waves and vaccination rollouts.

## 🧪 Data Transformation

All COVID-19 data preprocessing and cleaning steps were performed using:

> **Notebook:** `transformations_covid.ipynb`

Key transformation steps included:
- Cleaning null or missing values.
- Standardizing country and date formats.
- Creating aggregated metrics (total cases, deaths, vaccinations).
- Preparing datasets for visualization and analysis.

---

## 🔎 Key Insights

- 📈 Daily trends of confirmed cases and deaths.
- 🌍 Top affected countries by number of cases and death rates.
- 💉 Vaccination progress and its correlation with reduced mortality.
- 🕒 Analysis of multiple pandemic waves across regions.
